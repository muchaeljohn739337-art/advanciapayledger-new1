**Structure:**

**1. Pain (Problem)**
Start with the frustration: "Sending crypto across different networks is a headache."

**2. Agitate (Make it worse)**
Remind them why it matters: "You have to use multiple bridges, pay fees twice, and wait 30+ minutes for confirmations. One wrong address and your funds are gone forever."

**3. Solution (Your product)**
Present the relief: "Advancia Pay handles multi-chain swaps automatically. One click, one interface, one fee. Your crypto moves across networks while you move on with your day."

**4. Proof (Why it works)**
Show evidence: "We've processed 50,000+ cross-chain swaps with a 99.99% success rate."

**5. Call-to-Action**
Make it easy: "Try your first swap now - no fees on your first transaction."

**Example in action:**
[Pain] Tired of juggling five different wallets for five different networks?
[Agitate] Every transfer means switching apps, manually bridging, and hoping you got the address right.
[Solution] Advancia Pay unifies everything. One wallet, all your networks, automatic bridging.
[Proof] 10,000+ users already simplified their crypto life.

**Structure:**

**Feature:** What it is (the facts)
"Advancia Pay supports five blockchain networks: Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, and Optimism."

**Advantage:** What it enables (the capability)
"This means you can send and receive crypto on any of these networks without managing separate wallets or addresses."

**Benefit:** What it means for them (the outcome)
"You save time, reduce errors, and never miss a payment because someone sent to the 'wrong' network."

**Formula:**
[Feature] → [Advantage] → [Benefit]

**Examples:**

1. **Real-time bed management** → Track occupancy updates instantly → Make faster admission decisions and never overbook

2. **Automatic crypto-to-USD conversion** → Withdrawals are calculated at current market rates → You always know exactly how much you're getting

3. **WebSocket transaction monitoring** → Get notified the second a payment arrives → Respond to customers faster and close deals sooner

**When to use each element:**
• Feature only: Technical documentation, specs
• Feature + Advantage: Product descriptions
• Feature + Advantage + Benefit: Marketing copy, sales`,

**Structure:**

**1. Acknowledge**
Show you understand: "I can see your withdrawal has been pending for 45 minutes - I know that's frustrating."
→ Validates their concern
→ Shows empathy
→ Builds trust

**2. Explain**
Give context without excuses: "Ethereum network congestion is higher than usual today, which is slowing down all transactions network-wide."
→ Educates the user
→ Shows it's not just them
→ Explains without blaming

**3. Solve**
Provide the resolution: "I've escalated your transaction to priority processing. You should see it complete within the next 15 minutes."
→ Clear action taken
→ Specific timeline
→ Shows you're on it

**4. Verify**
Confirm and prevent: "I'll personally monitor this and email you the moment it's complete. I've also added you to our priority list for future transactions during high-traffic periods."
→ Follow-up commitment
→ Extra service
→ Prevents recurrence

**Full Example:**

"I can see your withdrawal has been pending for 45 minutes - I know that's frustrating when you need the funds now.

The Ethereum network is experiencing higher congestion than usual today (you can see current network status here: [link]), which is slowing down all transactions network-wide, not just ours.

I've escalated your transaction to priority processing and increased the gas fee to speed it up. You should see it complete within the next 15 minutes.

I'll personally monitor this and email you the moment it's complete. In the future, you can check our network status page before withdrawing to see if delays are expected, or use a faster network like Polygon for urgent transfers."`,
